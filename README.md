This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug caused by loose typing and the unexpected behavior of arithmetic operators when dealing with non-numeric operands. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that explicitly handles type checking before performing arithmetic operations.  The bug arises from JavaScript's implicit type coercion, which can lead to unexpected NaN (Not a Number) results.
